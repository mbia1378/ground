# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

Before starting work on a change, comment on one of the [open issues](https://github.com/google/ground-android/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
saying you'd like to take it on. If one does not exist, you can also
[create one here](https://github.com/google/ground-android/issues/new).

Be sure to reference this issue number in your pull request (e.g., 
"Fix truncated text values #27"), and preferably in your commit message.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
